Chorus.ai was sold to ZoomInfo for $575M. I consider myself a generalist with broad, but non-expert, technical understanding in a wide range of technical fields (e.g., chemistry, fluid mechanics, quantum physics, thermodynamics, signal analysis). My strengths are understanding complex and connected systems that intersect multiple domains. I spent 8 years at Bain & Company advising Fortune 500 businesses on operations and strategy on projects ranging from improving mill extraction in Alaskan gold mines to reducing manufacturing complexity in semiconductors.\n\nI was the first hire at Innovation Endeavors 2009-2010 and am like to get deeply involved in a small number of early stage companies that want to have a significant impact on global GDP. I hold a Bachelor of Applied Science, Engineering Science from the University of Toronto and MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n",
